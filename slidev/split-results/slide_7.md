# Algorithms for Performance Enhancement

- **Planning Algorithms**: Zero-shot-CoT and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) boost GPT-4's turn-based performance by 1-2%, but offer minimal gains in session-based evaluations.
- **Selection Algorithms**: Content and API selection improve GPT-4's turn-based performance by 1-5% by filtering irrelevant inputs and reducing token costs.
- **Limitations**: Current planning algorithms often fail in multi-turn sessions and can worsen performance due to error propagation.
